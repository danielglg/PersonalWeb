<h2 id="introduction">What is EMV?</h2>

<h3>What is EMV?</h3>
<p>
  EMV is both a payment method and an interoperability standard (the acronym stands for the three initial companies that developed it: Europay, Mastercard and Visa). 
</p>
<p>
  EMV standardizes the technical methods for smart payment cards (which include integrated circuit chips), payment terminals (POS: Point Of Sale) and automated teller machines (ATM).
</p>
<p>
  More information on
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMV" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> and
  <a href="https://www.emvco.com/" target="_blank">EMVCo</a>
  (organism currently in charge of the specifications).
</p>

<h3>What is Airport-Pay?</h3>
  <p>
    Amadeus Airport Pay is an Amadeus solution which is:
    the only CUTE-independent, multi-merchant enabled, √Åltea-DCS integrated, EMV payment solution for airlines and ground handlers.
    That's why EMV component is a core component in the solution.
  </p>
  <p>
    It means that it allows these merchants to accept EMV chip card payments anywhere at the airport, in any airport worldwide, which is completely independent of the shared environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    For instance, paying for ancillary services can be a painful experience for the traveller, as without the solution cardholders have to physically visit the sales desk and handover the card for using less secure paymeny methods.
    In addition without it, being PCI-DSS compliant is much more difficult for airlines.
  </p>
  <p>
    At kiosks, the solution offers the integration with the DCS and the reservation system of the merchant.
  </p>
  <p>
    It applies to travellers with EMV chip cards or EMV compliant mobile wallets.
    The cards accepted are: Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Diners Club, Girocard, ...
  </p>
  <p>
    Deploy quicker and more ancillary sales conversion.
  </p>
  <p>
    It gives the merchant the flexibility to choose its own bank as well.
  <p>
    PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards). Credit card data fully encrypted and decrypted, Diagram of slide 8.

  <p>
    It offers the next desirable features:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Supported functionalities: payment transactions, EMV cards, magstripe cards, monetary compensayions (credit transactions), NFC contactless payments, wallet payments, DCC, (installments not supported in 2017).</li>
    <li>Wireless POS devices.</li>
    <li>Can enrich payment processes (HOT, daily report, etc.) with EMV data.</li>
    <li>Amadeus (several options) or merchant frontends (via web services).</li>
    <li>PNR integrated.</li>
    <li>Supports on-line and pin-offline PIN verification.</li>
    <li>Multi-environment: multi-merchant, multi-acquirer, multi-currency and multi-language.</li>
    <li>Applicable to attended (DCS, ticket ofice) and unatteded (kiosk) POS.</li>

<h3>Modern functionalities</h3>

<h4>Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC))</h4>
<p>
  It is a feature applicable in foreign exchange (FX) payments: the POS is configured with a local currency different that the currency set
  in cardholder's card and offers the cardholder to choose one of these currencies for the payment (commissions vary depending on the elected currency).
</p>

<h4>Business intelligence (BI) AppEvents</h4>
<p>
  At key stages of the payment with a POS, the EMV backend generates events containing EMV-related data.
  Such events are used to feed Amadeus products that aggregate business intelligence information interesting for both
  Amadeus and customers.
</p>

<h4>Kibana events</h4>
<p>
  Similar to BI events, but feeding Kibana and having only Amadeus as stakeholder.
  Data and events generated can differ from BI events.
