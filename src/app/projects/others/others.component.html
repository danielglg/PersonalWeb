    Personal website.
</h1>

<p>
    This website. Built using Angular, PrimeNG, Mirosoft's Visual Studio Code and browser development tools.
    In the future a NodeJS backend will be added to support functionalities like e-mail communications and captchas.
</p>

<h1>
    Operating systems
</h1>

<p>
    ► Studied operating system foundations (e.g. processes, protection mechanisms, system calls, structure, classification, real-time).
</p>
<p>
    ► Studied management of processor (e.g. Process Control Block, process states, threads, scheduler, scheduling algorithms, signalling). Focus on UNIX (Pthreads) and Win32 threads.
</p>
<p>
    ► Studied concurrent computing and concurrence tools in Unix (e.g. concurrence problems, shared memory, mutex, semaphores, conditional variables, message queuing, pipes, signals).
</p>
<p>
    ► Studied memory management (e.g. virtual pages), input/output architectures and file systems (Windows and Unix based systems) 
</p>
<p>
    ► Installed an Unix operating system (FreeBSD), learnt the environment (e.g. commands, structure) and developed a simple application within this environment using C language (example of tools used: bash, sh, vi, gcc, GNU make, gdb). Finally, practiced management of processes.  
</p>
<p>
    ► Using the previous system, developed and tested a web server that has a variable number of threads and communicates with other processes (CGI). Tools used: C language, Pthreads, system signals, pipes, lynx.
</p>
<p>
    ► Developed and tested a multithreaded cache web server using Java and Eclipse. Tools used: Eclipse, several web navigators, communication and synchronization tools offered by Java (queues, mutex, condition variables). Throughout the project, analysed and solved concurrence problems that appear in this sort of application.
</p>


<h1>
    Advanced application programming
</h1>

<p>
    ► Delivered four projects, each one was an email client created with the following technologies (commented in next bullets): AWT, SWING, JSP and Java Servlets.
</p>
<p>
    ► Learnt advanced concepts of object oriented programming (e.g. list, stack, queue, set, map, hash; sorting, comparators; recursion) using Java.
</p>
<p>
    ► Learnt how to design and develop graphical user interfaces (GUI) using AWT and SWING APIs (Java): components, event model, layout managers, Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.
</p>
<p>
    ► Learnt how to design and develop web-server applications using Java (J2SE, J2EE): Servlet, JSP, JavaBeans, databases (JDBC), protocols (e.g. HTTP), Apache Tomcat, software architectures (client-server, programming models in tiers, state control).
</p>

<h1>
    Modelling languages
</h1>

<p>
    ► We, a team of 12 people, conceived and designed a future “smart sport center” by means of a set of telematic services. I was one of the four project managers and became one of the leaders of the project.
</p>
<p>
    Once the project was conceived and agreed, we carried out the requirements analysis and the design of the software architecture in several phases (from lower to higher detail and evaluating our decisions). We applied the concepts commented in next bullet. We delivered specific documents and did presentations when defined milestones/deadlines arrived. The result of our work was a document with the detailed design. 
</p>
<p>
    ► Several topics were covered:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Object Oriented Programming and modelling, using the Unified Modelling Language (UML). Analysis of design decisions and problems.
    </li>
    <li>
        Software development lifecycle and methodologies (e.g. waterfall, waterfall with feedback, spiral, unified process, scrum, extreme programming, incremental, component assembly, etc.). 
    </li>
    <li>
        Modelling software requirements with informal and formal languages, as formal language UML was learnt and employed. Usage of UML too for documenting our design. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Managing requirements (e.g. functional, non-functional, level of detail, priority, etc.).
    </li>
    <li>
        Software architectures and design patterns (e.g. adapter, factory method, observer, etc.).
    </li>
</ul>

<h1>
    Virtual instrumentation (data acquisition systems fundamentals)
</h1>

<p>
    ► Implemented control system of an oven (it comprises: DAQ, heater, fan; tools for monitoring and controlling sensors, actuators and signals; tools for storing and getting back historical data). Convenient software architectures and design patterns (such as master-slave, producer-consumer and state machines) were used. Queues, semaphores, threads, local/global variables and events, among others, are key tools in the programming of the system. Other things done: DAQ interfacing, building the application release deliverable, analysis and control of application stages (startup, running and shut down). LabVIEW was the language and IDE used.
</p>

<h1>
    Networks and services ubiquitous and secure
</h1>

<p>
    ► Conceived, designed, implemented, simulated and tested control system for greenhouses or similar environments, employing a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). The system comprises a sink, a server and several Sun SPOT motes and must manage several types of measurements, alarms and commands; as well as do not fail within a real environment (using physical nodes).
    I lead the project within a team of 4 people. Due to human resource and knowledge issues, I did major parts: trained 2 of my workmates in Java, PDU structure and system design; designed the software architecture from low-level detail to high-level and coded it in Java. All of us performed the requirement analysis, the general design of the system (e.g. PDU structures and listening ports), the definition of the validation tests, the generation of documentation and the presentation of the system. Tools employed: UML, NetBeans, Java (J2ME).
</p>

<h1>
    Services and protocols engineering
</h1>

<p>
    ► Analysed performance and security flaws in an existent P2P based set of protocols for 3D data streaming within the research community. Then, proposed fixes. Throughout the subject, elaborated explanatory presentations and research papers. It was purely individual work.
</p>

<h1>
    Digital image processing, Audio and video signal processing, Signal recognition techniques
</h1>

<p>
    ► Implemented and tested many signal processing algorithms and applications using Matlab. Some required initial design and research. Few examples:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Digital image processing (e.g. transforms, filters, point operations, JPEG coding). 
    </li>
    <li>
        Pattern recognition, multimedia indexing and retrieval techniques.
    </li>
</ul>

<h1>
