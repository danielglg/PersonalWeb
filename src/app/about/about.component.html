    <h1>Presentation</h1>
    <p>
    Curiosity and creativity have always driven my growth. When I was a chiled I enjoyed reading, painting and creative toys such as Lego and K'nex. Later on, composing music became my main passion.
    Soon I realized that I wanted to design, build and produce things, so I focused towards the engineering world. All made me choose to pursue a life within telecommunication engineering.
    Once finished my studies at university I tried to step in this world, which have me evolved as business and my own interest evolved, presenting me different opportunities at distinct sectors and companies.
    I have met great workmates throughout the way and hope the future brings good opportunities too.
